# hopenet_mxJiang

This project aims to identify one's gazing directions (yaw, pitch, roll) in a video by converting Deep-Head-Pose Hopenet in Pytorch to MXNet Gluon for better production efficiency. 

The original Pytorch algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose.
