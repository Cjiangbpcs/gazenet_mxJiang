# hopenet_mxJiang

Deep-Head-Pose Hopenet, aiming to identify one's gazing directions in a video, is converted from Pytorch to MXNet Gluon in this repository. 

The accuracy of this gluon version is comparable to its original Pytorch version. 

The pre-trained parameters and architectures can be requested via issues. They can be used to test on your own videos.

The original Pytorch algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose.
